This bug will be filed against the package file. To avoid duplicate reports,
please make sure you have checked the BTS on that package.

Please consider your severities.

If you wish for a new filetype being recognized, this is a wishlist bug.
Most bugs reported against the file package are in this category.
If what file reports now is wildly wrong or misleading, a higher severity
may be appropriate.

If file correctly reports the filetype, but you would like to receive
additional information about the file (such as the resolution of an image),
this is also wishlist. Please bear in mind that such requests will likely
be ignored when they are not accompanied by a patch.
