You are about to report a bug in the source package. Unless this is about a
build failure, this is probably not what you intend to do.

If you want to report a bug in the NFS client, you should use the package
name nfs-common. If you want to report a bug in the NFS server, you should
use the package name nfs-kernel-server.
