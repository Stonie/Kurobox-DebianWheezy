- Change references to /e/n/r to /r/n when it's safe to do;
  also remove ifupdown-clean script.

Partially solved with use of PGF/TikZ:
{
- The documentation in pdf generated by the .dia files does not show
  up properly (it is bigger than the PDF itself)

- There is currently no way to build an ifudown-doc package. Since dia
  cannot be used without a $DISPLAY the only alternatives are to 
  either build the dia stuff manually (for autobuilders) and build the
  docs with the package or build all the docs manually and use a 
  a 'clean-everything-but-docs' target to clean the package when building.
}

- More documentation on how to configure ifupdown for different goals
  is needed. A lot of content is already available in
  the Debian Reference, but more detailed examples would be useful
  (and should be included in a separate ifupdown-doc package)
