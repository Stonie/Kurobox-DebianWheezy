- The documentation in pdf generated by the .dia files does not show
  up properly (it is bigger than the PDF itself)

- There is currently no way to build an ifudown-doc package. Since dia
  cannot be used without a $DISPLAY the only alternatives are to 
  either build the dia stuff manually (for autobuilders) and build the
  docs with the package or build all the docs manually and use a 
  a 'clean-everything-but-docs' target to clean the package when building.

- More documentation on how to configure ifupdown for different goals
  is needed. A lot of content is already available in
  the Debian Reference, but more detailed examples would be useful
  (and should be included in a separate ifupdown-doc package)
  See: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference/ch-gateway.en.html#s-net-high)

- When compiling the package there are errors related to po files not being
  correct. This is because of the current hack for woody compatibility in
  debian/rules. Remove when sarge is released?
