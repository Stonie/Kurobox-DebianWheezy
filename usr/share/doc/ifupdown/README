Migrating /etc/network/run to a different place
===============================================

In the latest ifupdown, the ifupdown state is stored by default in 
/run/network, and /etc/network/run is set up to be a symlink 
to that location. That was made because the default location is 
sometimes read-only, /dev/shm isn't really a right place for it too, 
and /lib/init/rw is in the process of being deprecated.

The migration is done by default.
