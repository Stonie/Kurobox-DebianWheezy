netselect for Debian
====================

running netselect without setuid root
-------------------------------------
You might want to run netselect without setuid root, via file capabilities on
linux.

Starting with linux >= 2.6.24 and using a filesystem supporting POSIX extended
attributes you can set cap_net_raw on netselect thanks to setcap shipped inside
libcap2-bin:

setcap cap_net_raw=ep /usr/bin/netselect

at this point you can remove setuid on netselect

chmod u-s /usr/bin/netselect
