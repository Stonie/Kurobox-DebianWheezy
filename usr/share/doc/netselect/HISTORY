This program was adapted by Avery Pennarun from the traceroute program by
Van Jacobson, which had been subsequently ported to Linux by Matt Day
<mday@artisoft.com>.  traceroute was released under the BSD license, and
thus so is this program.

The README.linux in traceroute said the following:

	This is a port of 4.4BSD traceroute for Linux.

	This version of traceroute also includes a fix for a bug that could
	cause traceroute to hang indefinitely in certain cases.  See the
	wait_for_reply() function in traceroute.c for details.

	The supplied binary was compiled on Linux 1.1.49 with gcc 2.5.8.

	Note that the kernel modification mentioned in the README is not
	needed on Linux.

	Matt Day <mday@artisoft.com>
