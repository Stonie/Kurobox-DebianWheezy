This is the Debian GNU/Linux package of NMAP -- The Network Mapper, 
by Fyodor <fyodor@insecure.org>.  Please see http://nmap.org/.

This package was crafted by LaMont Jones <lamont@debian.org> using:

NMAP is copyright 1997-2003 by Fyodor <fyodor@insecure.org> and others,
and distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Version 2.

On Debian GNU/Linux systems, the complete text of the GNU General
Public License can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.

The actual Nmap license (minus the copy of GPL-2 mentioned above):

  The main Nmap code is covered under the Nmap license, which is the GPL
  with a few clarifications/exceptions. A copy of that can be found at
  http://insecure.org/nmap/data/COPYING .

  The Nmap Security Scanner also uses 3rd party open source libraries
  for various functions. Some or all of these may be necessary or
  desirable to distribute Nmap. All use BSD-style licenses. If they
  are included, their license must be followed. This document briefly
  describes how and when each library is used, and details the license
  terms. The six libraries are the the LibPcap raw packet capture
  library, WinPcap Windows Packet Capture Library, Libdnet raw
  networking library, LibPCRE perl-compatable regular expression
  library, Lua programming language, and the OpenSSL SSL encryption
  library.

  ==LibPcap Raw Packet Capture Library==

  LibPcap is used by Nmap on UNIX for raw packet reading during host
  discovery, port scanning, and OS detection. It is available from
  http://www.tcpdump.org. It is bundled with the Nmap Security Scanner
  in the libpcap-possiblymodified subdirectory. The BSD-style license
  for version 0.8.3 follows:

  ==WinPcap Windows Packet Library==

  WinPcap is used by Nmap on Windows for raw packet reading during host
  discovery, port scanning, and OS detection. It is available from
  http://winpcap.polito.it/. It is a derivative of LibPcap, so that
  license (above) must be followed as well. The BSD-style license terms

  required on all platforms for low-level tasks such as sending raw
  Ethernet frames. Version 1.10 is distributed under the following

  ==Lua programming language==

  The LUA programming language may optionally be embedded into Nmap as
  part of the Nmap Scripting Engine functionality. LUA will not be
  included if the â€“without-liblua configuration option is given. If Lua
  is included, Nmap also includes some LUA modules which also fall under
  the free LUA license. The LUA license is as follows:

  ==OpenSSL SSL encryption library==

  OpenSSL can optionally be used by Nmap Service Detection to
  communicate with SSL-enabled protocols such as https, pop3-s, imaps,
  etc. Its BSD-style license is too long to include here, but available
  from http://www.openssl.org/ . OpenSSL is not bundled with Nmap.
