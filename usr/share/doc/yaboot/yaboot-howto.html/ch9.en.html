<p>
If you have a problem booting, don't panic.  Yaboot can boot any installed
Linux kernel and system from the boot: prompt.

<h2>9.1 Resetting the NVRAM</h2>

<p>
Hold the Command-Option-p-r keys all together at startup to reset all nvram
parameters to their factory defaults.  Hold the keys until you hear the startup
chime two or three times.  If the setup recommendations were followed, the
<code>yaboot</code> installation will be be the first bootable partition and
OpenFirmware will boot it automatically.  It should be noted that MacOS
settings such as virtual memory, startup disk, and screen resolution will also
be reset to their defaults.

<h2>9.2 Loading Yaboot</h2>

<p>
If a <samp>boot:</samp> prompt isn't presented, then <code>yaboot</code> isn't
being loaded.  You can load it manually from OpenFirmware.  Holding the
Command-Option-o-f keys all together after pressing the power-on key will give
you an OpenFirmware prompt

<pre>
         0 &gt;
</pre>

<p>
(Command is the key with the cloverleaf and/or apple engraved on it).

<p>
At the OF prompt, you will need to use OpenFirmware paths for most of the boot
configuration items.  You can determine most OpenFirmware paths from the OF
prompt using a few OF commands, then construct an OF boot command to directly
boot your kernel.

<p>
The full OpenFirmware path consists of three parts in the format

<pre>
         device-name:partition-number,/filesystem-path
</pre>

<p>
The OF command devalias will list all the device aliases effective on your
system.  You may see some of these:

<pre>
       Name      Device Type
       ----      --------------------------------------------------
       hd        internal ide drive (primary controller, master disk)
       ultra1    internal ide drive (primary controller, slave disk)
       ide0      ide drive (secondary controller, master disk)
       ide1      ide drive (secondary controller, slave disk)
       cd        CD-ROM 
       zip       Zip drive
       fw        FireWire interface
       fd        Floppy drive
       enet      Ethernet interface
</pre>

<p>
Append the partition number of the boot partition (in our recommendation, 2)
and then follow that with <samp>,yaboot</samp> to boot the <code>yaboot</code>
file on the boot partition.

<pre>
         0 &gt; boot hd:2,yaboot
</pre>

<p>
Hit return, and <code>yaboot</code> should be loaded and display its
<code>boot:</code> prompt.  If you don't know the partition number, just start
at 2 and work your way up until you hit it.

<h2>9.3 Manually Loading a Kernel Image</h2>

<p>
Once you have the boot: prompt, you can enter a label defined in your
<code>yaboot.conf</code> to boot that kernel image.  Or instead of a label, you
can enter a full OpenFirmware path.  A typical kernel path might be

<pre>
         boot: hd:3,/vmlinux
</pre>

<p>
To pass parameters to the kernel, add them on to the <samp>boot:</samp> prompt
line after the kernel label or path.  You'll need to specify <samp>root=</samp>
as a minimum, but you can add any kernel parameters desired.  Here's an
example;

<pre>
         boot: hd:3,/vmlinux root=/dev/hda3 ro
</pre>
