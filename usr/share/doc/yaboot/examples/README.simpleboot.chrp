This is the old basic ofboot.b wrapper, it has been replaced by a more
robust CHRP script that is able to dual or tri-boot GNU/Linux, MacOS,
and MacOS X.  See README.ofboot.b for more information.

OpenFirmware on newworld macs by default searches for HFS partitions
with a `blessed' directory, and then checks for a file with an HFS
filetype of `tbxi' if found it loads this file. Unfortunately OF is
being far to picky about the format of this file, while it will load a
ELF executable just fine when directed to, if the tbxi file it finds
is just a plain ELF executable, as yaboot is, then it refuses to load
it.

The best longterm solution is to embed a small CHRP boot script to the
head of of the yaboot executable, but until we can find the right way
to do that we can use a small wrapper instead. The file included
called simple_ofboot.b does nothing more then run the OF command "boot
hd:,\\yaboot" which should load the yaboot executable on most machines
if you use the stock internal hard disk.  You might have to change
that device path (hd:) to match the device path to your bootstrap
partition, such as hd:2,\\yaboot.  Or you can dispense with the
wrapper altogether and reset the boot-device variable in OF to point
directly at the yaboot executable and that will work too.  This
wrapper just allows for most (hopefully) machines to boot
transparently without any OF reconfiguration.

If you have G4 hardware then your OpenFirmware may already have a
graphical boot selector built in, this selector can be accessed by
holding down the option key when booting the machine.  You should see
a screen with buttons for each bootable partition.  This version of
ofboot.b includes a badge icon, the button with a penguin icon is your
bootstrap partition.  If you decide to use this built in selector you
really do not need to use the menu_ofboot.b script provided in this
package. Thanks to Nicholas Humfrey for creating the Badge icon.

Hopefully soon these problems will have better solutions at some
point. If you happen to know OF well and have any suggestions they are
most welcome!
