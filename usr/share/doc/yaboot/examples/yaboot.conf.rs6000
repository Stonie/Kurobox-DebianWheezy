## Example yaboot.conf for ybin and yaboot >= 0.6
## see man yaboot.conf for more details.

## Change `unconfigured' to your bootstrap partition ie: /dev/hda2
boot=unconfigured

## device is the OpenFirmware device path to the disk containing
## kernel images.  if your disk is /dev/hda you can find the
## OpenFirmware path by running the command: ofpath /dev/hda DO NOT
## specify a partition number for this!  This is generally not
## necessary for IBM hardware

#device=hd:

## partition is the partition number where the kernel images are
## located.  The kernel images should be on your root filesystem, so
## this is usually the same partition number as your root filesystem.
## so if root = /dev/hda3 (the 3rd partition) then you should have
## partition=3  This *MUST* be set correct or yaboot won't boot!  This
## option can be either set globally as shown here, or per image in
## the image= sections

partition=3

## timeout is the amount of time in tenths of a second that yaboot
## will wait before booting the default kernel image (the first image=
## section in this config file or the value of default=).

timeout=20
install=/usr/local/lib/yaboot/yaboot

## nonvram is required for IBM hardware currently since ofpath does
## not support them, it is also probably not necessary.

nonvram

## Password supplied in plaintext, required for yaboot to boot, unless
## restricted is also present (see below).  Be sure to
## chmod 600 /etc/yaboot.conf if you set this!

#password=secret

## Password supplied as an md5 hash, see above

#password=$1$saltstrg$HnJ/gcM3oKhNbnzUPgXTD/

## A password is only required to boot an image specified here if
## parameters are specified on the command line or if the user enters
## an image is not specified in the configuration file at all (ie.
## arbitrary file load).  restricted can also be placed in an image
## section in that case any image not including the restricted keyword
## will be fully password protected.

#restricted

## image is the kernel itself, commonly kept in / but also commonly
## found in /boot.  Note that /boot should generally not be its own
## partition on powerpcs, its not necessary and complicates things.
## Make sure /boot is on the partition specified by partition= see
## above.  /boot should never be an HFS filesystem.  You may point
## image= to a symbolic link so long as the symlink does not cross
## partition boundries.

image=/vmlinux
	label=Linux
	root=/dev/sda3
	read-only
