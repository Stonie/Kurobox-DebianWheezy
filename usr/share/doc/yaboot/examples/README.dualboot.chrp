This script is deprecated in favor of a much nicer and more robust
script ofboot, see README.ofboot for more information.

This script was written by Benjamin Herrenschmidt, I added a X to the
OpenFirmware pathnames, you should replace that X with the proper
partition number. for the MacOS line add the partition number of your
MacOS partition, for the yaboot line add the partition number of your
bootstrap partition, which should be the same partition you configure
ybin to install on.

Remember that the Mac partition table is considered a partition in and
of itself, so partition number 1 is always the partition table. If the
disk is shared with MacOS it needs to have a MacOS disk driver
partition in which case the first `real' partition will probably be
number 4.

Edit this script before running ybin or mkofboot.

If you have G4 hardware then your OpenFirmware may already have a
graphical boot selector built in, this selector can be accessed by
holding down the option key when booting the machine.  You should see
a screen with buttons for each bootable partition.  This version of
ofboot.b includes a badge icon, the button with a penguin icon is your
bootstrap partition.  If you decide to use this built in selector you
really do not need to use dualboot.chrp.  Thanks to Nicholas Humfrey
for creating the Badge icon.
