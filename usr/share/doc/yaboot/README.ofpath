This utility is used to find the OpenFirmware device path to a unix
device node (ie /dev/hda2).

Ofpath will work on Newworld PowerMacs only if yaboot is used as the
bootloader, it will not work on newworld macs booted with BootX.

Ofpath will also work on most Oldworld PowerMacs, unlike Newworld, it
will work on BootX booted Oldworld machines. Note that oldworld
support is not well tested and may not give accurate results.

ofpath supports the following command line switches:

      --debug                print boring junk only useful for debugging
  -h, --help                 display this help and exit
  -V, --version              output version information and exit

Ybin will use this utility automatically to find the OpenFirmware
device path when macos=, macosx= are set to unix device nodes in
/etc/yaboot.conf, and/or if ofboot= is not defined.

ofpath is based on show_of_path.sh written by Olaf Hering, this
version unlike show_of_path.sh works with /bin/ash and is fully
functional on stripped down systems such as boot or rescue floppies.
It has been tested on the Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (potato) boot
floppies.
