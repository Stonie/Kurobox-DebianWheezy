This is a new OpenFirmware CHRP script designed to be automatically
configured by ybin.  It is more robust then previous CHRP scripts, it
includes the following capabilities:

* Multibooting GNU/Linux, MacOS 8.* or 9.* MacOSX, Darwin, direct from
* CDROM, Network and into an OpenFirmware prompt.

* Presenting a real menu of OS choices.

* Automatic configuration by ybin.  This script should NOT be edited
  by the user.  It should also not be used without ybin, its not
  directly useable by OpenFirmware.

* Configurable colors.  (see the yaboot.conf(5) man page).

The multiboot menu is only presented when an extra OS is defined in
/etc/yaboot.conf, otherwise this script loads yaboot without any user
interaction.

To enable a multi boot menu add bsd=ofpath and/or macos=ofpath and/or
macosx=ofpath, and/or darwin=ofpath where ofpath is the OpenFirmware
device path to the MacOS or MacOSX boot partition.  Example:
macos=hd:10 you can also specify a unix device node, ie: /dev/hda5,
and ybin will translate it automatically using ofpath.

This script when presenting a dual boot menu will wait for a defined
number of seconds before automatically booting the default OS.  Both
this delay and the default OS can be configured in /etc/yaboot.conf.

The delay is configured by adding delay=seconds.  Unlike timeout this
is in seconds rather then 10ths of seconds.  This option has no effect
on the yaboot boot: prompt timeout.  If delay= is not set, ybin will
translate the value of timeout= to seconds and use that.

The default OS is configured by adding defaultos=macos.  There is only
four values that are acceptable: linux, bsd, macos, macosx and darwin.  The
default is linux.  This should not be confused with yaboot's
`default=' variable.

The name and letter used to load MacOS or MacOSX (M and X
respectively) cannot be be configured.  (others are D for Darwin, C
for CDROM, N for network, and O for OpenFirmware)

The Forth code in this script was written by Chris Emerson and iNOUE Koich!.

This script has only been formally tested on a Rev 1 Blue G3, a G4,
and an ibook, please report any incompatibilities.
