This is a collection of modules that are for dealing with Debian related
data. Each module is documented with it's own README file, or some examples.

Currently supported are

  * Debtags data with debtags.py
  * Debian changelogs with changelog.py
  * Packages files and the like with deb822.py
  * .deb files (and .ar files FWIW) via debfile.py

Some of the modules will use python-apt for some of the functions. It should
make no difference if it is installed, but if you find a bug installing it
might help.

If you have a module that is for manipulation or interrogation of Debian 
specific data then consider adding it to this package. You can discuss it with 
the maintainers by contacting

  pkg-python-debian-discuss@lists.alioth.debian.org
