This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the "man_db" manual page
browser utility package, version 2.5.2. It was originally written by Graeme
Wilford <G.Wilford@ee.surrey.ac.uk>, with documentation reorganized by Nils
Magnus <n_magnus@informatik.uni-kl.de>. Until 2001 it was maintained by the
late Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>. It is now maintained by Colin
Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>.

The original upstream sources as maintained by Graeme Wilford are
available at ftp://ftp.ee.surrey.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/wilf/man_db/.

The current upstream source is held in Bazaar at http://man-db.nongnu.org/,
and future upstream releases will take place from there.
