I have documented some of update-inetd's design issues in

    http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/09/msg00611.html

and, with the help of Roger Leigh, made a proposal for a cleaner solution (the
above url has a second, much simplified version of the original proposal).

However, there has been no consensus on the proposal. In the meantime, I don't
see a clean way forward for dealing with most of update-inetd's pending bugs.
