debsums: Check the integrity of the packages files
	Suspecting a package has been compromised by another application
	or a virus or so? Run this tool to find out if anything happened
	to the files.

== For the system administrator ==

In order to have md5sums for all installed packages from the downloaded
binary packages via APT:
 1. Install this debsums package while enabling auto-gen (default).
 2. Run debsums_init from root while having consistent /etc/apt/sources.list

Filtering output of the cron job
---------------------------------

debsums now filters the output of the daily cron job by excluding
the contents of /etc/debsums-ignore

You can add lines to this file using the following format (similar to
logcheck):
 
E.g.
  ^/usr/bin/module-assistant$
  ^/usr/share/misc/pci.ids$

== For the package developer ==

To generate md5sums in debian/rules from any package:

1. chdir to debian/<binary-package-name> (or whatever it is called)

2. Run the following commands (excerpt from debstd)

        md5sum `find * -type f ! -regex "DEBIAN/.*"` >DEBIAN/md5sums </dev/null
        chmod 644 DEBIAN/md5sums

3. The same can be accomplished by running dh_md5sums
