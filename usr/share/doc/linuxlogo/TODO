- make the "-i" option work

- handle the case if two logos have the same name...

- allow specifying a directory full of logos, so you don't
  have to build them all into linux_logo

- make sure no buffer-overflows.  strncat is no help here.

- get locale path from LOCALEPATH [is this still needed?  I am not
  an i18n expert ]

- Fix -i option

- Compress logos for smaller executable [might not be worth the trouble]

- script to make a "before" and "after" list of linux_logo results
  based on the cpuinfo collection, then diff after to make sure no
  regressions happened.
  
- Have architecture-specific default sysinfo output?
  That way archs like m68k that have extra info [like Amiga, Atari, Mac]
  can display this w/o adding hacks to make it look proper on archs
  w/o such info [ix86]
  
- see the ./libsysinfo directory for sysinfo stuff


Suggestions from others:

- Check the TERM value and use the ASCII logo if we don't have
  color support.

- Why not include #I in Format string to indicate time in HH:MM format?

- All text in output is printed in ESC[1;37;40m. It would be nice to
  have an option for that. For example: linux_logo -z 0-37-40 ...
