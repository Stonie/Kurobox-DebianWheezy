+ The build system has changed. 
  You now need to run ./configure before running make
+ Cross-compiling is now possible (see the README)  
+ getopt() is no longer used to parse command line options.
  Please report any bugs that might be caused by this.
+ The i18n support was re-worked.  Please try it out.
+ A large amount of code was re-written from scratch.
  Let me know of any regressions.
+ The loadaverage options now don't print times
  with 0 in them (i.e., it will print "2 days 1 minute"
  instead of "2 days 0 hours 1 minute")
+ You can now specify logos by name, rather than number.
  Maintainers please take note, this is now the preferred
    way of specifying logos.
