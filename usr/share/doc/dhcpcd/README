dhcpcd-3 - DHCP client daemon
Copyright 2006-2008 Roy Marples <roy@marples.name>


Installation
------------
Edit config.h to match your building requirements.

Take special note of ENABLE_DUID and unset it if the target media is 
volatile, like say a LiveCD.

Then just make; make install

man dhcpcd for command line options


Notes
-----
If you're cross compiling you may need to send HAVE_FORK=yes or HAVE_FORK=no
to the make command to avoid to automatic test.

We try and detect how to restart ntp and ypbind, you can override this with
HAVE_INIT=no or force one of these values
OPENRC   (OpenRC as used by Gentoo (forked from baselayout))
BSDRC    (BSD RC system - /etc/rc.d/ntpd restart )
SERVICE  (RedHat service command - service ntpd restart)
SLACKRC  (Slackware RC system - /etc/rc.d/rc.ntpd restart)
SYSV     (SYSV style - /etc/init.d/ntpd restart)

You can change the default dir where dhcpcd stores it's .info files with
INFODIR=/var/db

We now default to using -std=c99. For 64-bit linux, this always works, but
for 32-bit linux it requires either gnu99 or a patch to asm/types.h.
Most distros patch linux headers so this should work fine.
linux-2.6.24 finally ships with a working 32-bit header.
If your linux headers are older, or your distro hasn't patched them you can
set CSTD=gnu99 to work around this.
