GCC 4.4 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes
</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><code>__builtin_stdarg_start</code> has been completely
    removed from GCC.  Support for <code>&lt;varargs.h&gt;</code> had
    been deprecated since GCC 4.0.  Use
    <code>__builtin_va_start</code> as a replacement.  </li>

    <li>Some of the errors issued by the C++ front end that could be
    downgraded to warnings in previous releases by using
    <code>-fpermissive</code> are now warnings by default. They can be
    converted into errors by using <code>-pedantic-errors</code>.</li>

    <li>Use of the cpp assertion extension will now emit a warning
    when <code>-Wdeprecated</code> or <code>-pedantic</code> is used.
    This extension has been deprecated for many years, but never
    warned about.</li>

    <li>Packed bit-fields of type <code>char</code> were not properly
    bit-packed on many targets prior to GCC 4.4.  On these targets, the fix in
    GCC 4.4 causes an ABI change.  For example there is no longer a 4-bit
    padding between field <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in this structure:
    <pre>
    struct foo
    {
      char a:4;
      char b:8;
    } __attribute__ ((packed));</pre>
    <p>There is a new warning to help identify fields that are affected:</p>
    <pre>
    foo.c:5: note: Offset of packed bit-field 'b' has changed in GCC 4.4</pre>
    <p>The warning can be disabled with
    <code>-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat</code>.</p></li>

    <li>On ARM EABI targets, the C++ mangling of
    the <code>va_list</code> type has been changed to conform to the
    current revision of the EABI.  This does not affect the libstdc++
    library included with GCC.</li>

    <li>The SCOUNT and POS bits of the MIPS DSP control register are now
    treated as global. Previous versions of GCC treated these fields as
    call-clobbered instead.</li>

    <li>The MIPS port no longer recognizes the <code>h</code>
    <code>asm</code> constraint.  It was necessary to remove
    this constraint in order to avoid generating unpredictable
    code sequences.

    <p>One of the main uses of the <code>h</code> constraint
    was to extract the high part of a multiplication on
    64-bit targets.  For example:</p>
    <pre>
    asm ("dmultu\t%1,%2" : "=h" (result) : "r" (x), "r" (y));</pre>
    <p>You can now achieve the same effect using 128-bit types:</p>
    <pre>
    typedef unsigned int uint128_t __attribute__((mode(TI)));
    result = ((uint128_t) x * y) >> 64;</pre>
    <p>The second sequence is better in many ways.  For example,
    if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are constants, the
    compiler can perform the multiplication at compile time.
    If <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are not constants,
    the compiler can schedule the runtime multiplication
    better than it can schedule an <code>asm</code> statement.</p>
    </li>

    <li><p>Support for a number of older systems and recently
    unmaintained or untested target ports of GCC has been declared
    obsolete in GCC 4.4.  Unless there is activity to revive them, the
    next release of GCC will have their sources permanently
    <strong>removed</strong>.</p>

    <p>The following ports for individual systems on particular
    architectures have been obsoleted:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Generic a.out on IA32 and m68k (i[34567]86-*-aout*,
        m68k-*-aout*)</li>
      <li>Generic COFF on ARM, H8300, IA32, m68k and SH (arm-*-coff*,
        armel-*-coff*, h8300-*-*, i[34567]86-*-coff*, m68k-*-coff*,
        sh-*-*).  This does not affect other more specific targets
        using the COFF object format on those architectures, or the
        more specific H8300 and SH targets (h8300-*-rtems*,
        h8300-*-elf*, sh-*-elf*, sh-*-symbianelf*, sh-*-linux*,
        sh-*-netbsdelf*, sh-*-rtems*, sh-wrs-vxworks).</li>
      <li>2BSD on PDP-11 (pdp11-*-bsd)</li>
      <li>AIX 4.1 and 4.2 on PowerPC (rs6000-ibm-aix4.[12]*,
        powerpc-ibm-aix4.[12]*)</li>
      <li>Tuning support for Itanium1 (Merced) variants.  Note that
        code tuned for Itanium2 should also run correctly on Itanium1.</li>
    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>The <code>protoize</code> and <code>unprotoize</code>
    utilities have been obsoleted and will be removed in GCC 4.5.
    These utilities have not been installed by default since GCC
    3.0.</li>

    <li>Support has been removed for all the <a
    href="../gcc-4.3/changes.html#obsoleted">configurations obsoleted
    in GCC 4.3</a>.</li>

    <li>Unknown <code>-Wno-*</code> options are now silently ignored
    by GCC if no other diagnostics are issued. If other diagnostics
    are issued, then GCC warns about the unknown options.</li>
   
    <li>More information on porting to GCC 4.4 from previous versions
    of GCC can be found in
    the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/porting_to.html">porting
    guide</a> for this release.</li>
 </ul>

<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A new command-line switch <code>-findirect-inlining</code> has been
      added.  When turned on it allows the inliner to also inline indirect
      calls that are discovered to have known targets at compile time
      thanks to previous inlining.  </li>

    <li>A new command-line switch <code>-ftree-switch-conversion</code> has
      been added.  This new pass turns simple initializations of scalar
      variables in switch statements into initializations from a static array,
      given that all the values are known at compile time and the ratio between
      the new array size and the original switch branches does not exceed 
      the parameter <code>--param switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</code> 
      (default is eight).  </li>

    <li>A new command-line switch <code>-ftree-builtin-call-dce</code>
      has been added.  This optimization eliminates unnecessary calls
      to certain builtin functions when the return value is not used,
      in cases where the calls can not be eliminated entirely because
      the function may set <code>errno</code>.  This optimization is
      on by default at <code>-O2</code> and above.</li>

    <li>A new command-line switch <code>-fconserve-stack</code>
      directs the compiler to minimize stack usage even if it makes
      the generated code slower.  This affects inlining
      decisions.</li>

    <li>When the assembler supports it, the compiler will now emit
      unwind information using assembler <code>.cfi</code> directives.
      This makes it possible to use such directives in inline
      assembler code.  The new option <code>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</code>
      directs the compiler to not use <code>.cfi</code>
      directives.</li>

    <li><p>The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Graphite">Graphite</a>
      branch has been merged.  This merge has brought in a new
      framework for loop optimizations based on a polyhedral
      intermediate representation.  These optimizations apply to all
      the languages supported by GCC.  The following new code
      transformations are available in GCC 4.4:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li><code>-floop-interchange</code>
	  performs loop interchange transformations on loops.  Interchanging two
	  nested loops switches the inner and outer loops.  For example, given a
	  loop like:
	  <pre>
          DO J = 1, M
            DO I = 1, N
              A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
	  </pre>
	    <p>loop interchange will transform the loop as if the user had written:</p>
	      <pre>
          DO I = 1, N
            DO J = 1, M
              A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
	      </pre>
	    <p>which can be beneficial when <code>N</code> is larger than the caches,
	      because in Fortran, the elements of an array are stored in memory
	      contiguously by column, and the original loop iterates over rows,
	      potentially creating at each access a cache miss.</p>
	</li>
	<li><code>-floop-strip-mine</code>
	  performs loop strip mining transformations on loops.  Strip mining
	  splits a loop into two nested loops.  The outer loop has strides
	  equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the
	  original loop within a strip.  For example, given a loop like:
	  <pre>
          DO I = 1, N
            A(I) = A(I) + C
          ENDDO
	  </pre>
	  <p>loop strip mining will transform the loop as if the user had written:</p>
	    <pre>
          DO II = 1, N, 4
            DO I = II, min (II + 3, N)
              A(I) = A(I) + C
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
	    </pre>
	</li>
	<li><code>-floop-block</code>
	  performs loop blocking transformations on loops.  Blocking strip mines
	  each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of the
	  element loops fit inside caches.  For example, given a loop like:
	  <pre>
          DO I = 1, N
            DO J = 1, M
              A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
	  </pre>
	  <p>loop blocking will transform the loop as if the user had written:</p>
	  <pre>
          DO II = 1, N, 64
            DO JJ = 1, M, 64
              DO I = II, min (II + 63, N)
                DO J = JJ, min (JJ + 63, M)
                  A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
                ENDDO
              ENDDO
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
	  </pre>
	  <p>which can be beneficial when <code>M</code> is larger than the caches,
	    because the innermost loop will iterate over a smaller amount of data
	    that can be kept in the caches.</p>
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A new register allocator has replaced the old one.  It is
        called <em>integrated register allocator</em> (<em>IRA</em>)
        because coalescing, register live range splitting, and hard
        register preferencing are done on-the-fly during coloring.  It
        also has better integration with the reload pass.  IRA is a
        regional register allocator which uses modern Chaitin-Briggs
        coloring instead of Chow's priority coloring used in the old
        register allocator.  More info about IRA internals and options
        can be found in the GCC manuals.
    </li>
    <li>A new instruction scheduler and software pipeliner, based on 
        the selective scheduling approach, has been added.  The new pass
        performs instruction unification, register renaming, substitution
        through register copies, and speculation during scheduling.
        The software pipeliner is able to pipeline non-countable loops.
        The new pass is targeted at scheduling-eager in-order platforms.
        In GCC 4.4 it is available for the Intel Itanium platform
        working by default as the second scheduling pass (after register
        allocation) at the <code>-O3</code> optimization level.
    </li>

    <li>When using <code>-fprofile-generate</code> with a
      multi-threaded program, the profile counts may be slightly wrong
      due to race conditions.  The
      new <code>-fprofile-correction</code> option directs the
      compiler to apply heuristics to smooth out the inconsistencies.
      By default the compiler will give an error message when it finds
      an inconsistent profile.</li>

    <li>The new <code>-fprofile-dir=PATH</code> option permits setting
      the directory where profile data files are stored when
      using <code>-fprofile-generate</code> and friends, and the
      directory used when reading profile data files
      using <code>-fprofile-use</code> and friends.</li>

  </ul>

<h2>New warning options</h2>
  <ul>

    <li>The new <code>-Wframe-larger-than=NUMBER</code> option directs
      GCC to emit a warning if any stack frame is larger
      than <code>NUMBER</code> bytes.  This may be used to help ensure that
      code fits within a limited amount of stack space.</li>

    <li>The new <code>-Wno-mudflap</code> option disables warnings
      about constructs which can not be instrumented when
      using <code>-fmudflap</code>.</li>

  </ul>

<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Version 3.0 of the <a
    href="http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-specifications/">OpenMP specification</a>
    is now supported for the C, C++, and Fortran compilers.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>C family</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>A new <code>optimize</code> attribute was added to allow programmers to
    change the optimization level and particular optimization options for an
    individual function.  You can also change the optimization options via the
    <code>GCC optimize</code> pragma for functions defined after the pragma.
    The <code>GCC push_options</code> pragma and the
    <code>GCC pop_options</code> pragma allow you temporarily save and restore
    the options used.  The <code>GCC reset_options</code> pragma restores the
    options to what was specified on the command line.
    </li>

    <li>Uninitialized warnings do not require enabling optimization
    anymore, that is, <code>-Wuninitialized</code> can be used
    together with <code>-O0</code>.  Nonetheless, the warnings given
    by <code>-Wuninitialized</code> will probably be more accurate if
    optimization is enabled.
    </li>

    <li><code>-Wparentheses</code> now warns about expressions such as
    <code>(!x | y)</code> and <code>(!x &amp; y)</code>. Using explicit
    parentheses, such as in <code>((!x) | y)</code>, silences this
    warning.</li>

    <li><code>-Wsequence-points</code> now warns within
    <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>,<code>do while</code>
    and <code>for</code> conditions, and within <code>for</code>
    begin/end expressions.
    </li>

    <li>A new option <code>-dU</code> is available to dump definitions
    of preprocessor macros that are tested or expanded.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>C++</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="cxx0x_status.html">Improved experimental support for
    the upcoming ISO C++ standard, C++0x</a>. Including support
    for <code>auto</code>, inline namespaces, generalized initializer
    lists, defaulted and deleted functions, new character types, and
    scoped enums.</li>

    <li> Those errors that may be downgraded to warnings to build
    legacy code now mention <code>-fpermissive</code> when
    <code>-fdiagnostics-show-option</code> is enabled.</li>

    <li><code>-Wconversion</code> now warns if the result of a
    <code>static_cast</code> to enumeral type is unspecified because
    the value is outside the range of the enumeral type.
    </li>

    <li><code>-Wuninitialized</code> now warns if a non-static
    reference or non-static <code>const</code> member appears in a
    class without constructors.
    </li>

    <li>G++ now properly implements value-initialization, so objects with
    an initializer of <code>()</code> and an implicitly defined default
    constructor will be zero-initialized before the default constructor is
    called.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Runtime Library (libstdc++)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/status.html#id476343">
	Improved experimental support for the upcoming ISO C++ standard, 
	C++0x</a>, including:
      <ul>
      <li>Support for &lt;chrono&gt;, &lt;condition_variable&gt;, 
	&lt;cstdatomic&gt;, &lt;forward_list&gt;, &lt;initializer_list&gt;, 
	&lt;mutex&gt;, &lt;ratio&gt;, &lt;system_error&gt;, and 
	&lt;thread&gt;.</li>
      <li><code>unique_ptr</code>, &lt;algorithm&gt;
	additions, exception propagation, and support for the new
	character types in &lt;string&gt; and &lt;limits&gt;.</li>
      <li>Existing facilities now exploit initializer lists, defaulted and 
	deleted functions, and the newly implemented core C++0x features.</li>
      <li>The standard containers are more efficient together with stateful
	allocators.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Experimental support for non-standard pointer types in containers.</li>
    <li>The long standing libstdc++/30928 has been fixed for targets running
      glibc 2.10 or later.</li>
    <li>As usual, many small and larger bug fixes, in particular quite a few
      corner cases in &lt;locale&gt;.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Fortran</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>GNU Fortran now employs libcpp directly instead of using cc1 as an
    external preprocessor. The <a
    href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Preprocessing-Options.html">
    <code>-cpp</code></a> option was added to allow manual invocation of the
    preprocessor without relying on filename extensions.</li>

    <li>The <a
    href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Error-and-Warning-Options.html#index-g_t_0040code_007bWarray-temporaries_007d-125">
    <code>-Warray-temporaries</code></a> option warns about array temporaries
    generated by the compiler, as an aid to optimization.</li>

    <li>The <a
    href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Code-Gen-Options.html#index-g_t_0040code_007bfcheck-array-temporaries_007d-221">
    <code>-fcheck-array-temporaries</code></a> option has been added, printing
    a notification at run time, when an array temporary had to be created for
    an function argument. Contrary to <code>-Warray-temporaries</code> the
    warning is only printed if the array is noncontiguous.</li>

    <li>Improved generation of DWARF debugging symbols</li>

    <li>If using an intrinsic not part of the selected standard (via
      <code>-std=</code> and <code>-fall-intrinsics</code>) gfortran will now
      treat it as if this procedure were declared <code>EXTERNAL</code> and
      try to link to a user-supplied procedure. <code>-Wintrinsics-std</code>
      will warn whenever this happens. The now-useless option
      <code>-Wnonstd-intrinsic</code> was removed.</li>

    <li>The flag <code>-falign-commons</code> has been added to control the
      alignment of variables in COMMON blocks, which is enabled by default in
      line with previous GCC version. Using <code>-fno-align-commons</code> one
      can force commons to be contiguous in memory as required by the Fortran
      standard, however, this slows down the memory access. The option
      <code>-Walign-commons</code>, which is enabled by default, warns when
      padding bytes were added for alignment. The proper solution is to sort
      the common objects by decreasing storage size, which avoids the alignment
      problems.</li>

    <li>Fortran 2003 support has been extended: 
      <ul>
        <li>Wide characters (ISO 10646, UCS-4, <code>kind=4</code>) and UTF-8
          I/O is now supported (except internal reads from/writes to wide
          strings). <a
          href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Fortran-Dialect-Options.html#index-g_t_0040code_007bbackslash_007d-34">
          <code>-fbackslash</code></a> now supports also
          <code>\u<em>nnnn</em></code> and <code>\U<em>nnnnnnnn</em></code>
          to enter Unicode characters.</li>
        <li>Asynchronous I/O (implemented as synchronous I/O) and the
          <code>decimal=</code>, <code>size=</code>, <code>sign=</code>,
          <code>pad=</code>, <code>blank=</code>, and <code>delim=</code>
          specifiers are now supported in I/O statements.</li>
        <li>Support for Fortran 2003 structure constructors and for
          array constructor with typespec has been added.</li>
        <li>Procedure Pointers (but not yet as component in derived types
          and as function results) are now supported.</li>
        <li>Abstract types, type extension, and type-bound procedures (both
          <code>PROCEDURE</code> and <code>GENERIC</code> but not as
          operators). Note: As <code>CLASS</code>/polymorphyic types are
          not implemented, type-bound procedures with <code>PASS</code>
          accept as non-standard extension <code>TYPE</code> arguments.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fortran 2008 support has been added:
      <ul>
        <li>The <code>-std=f2008</code> option and support for the file
          extensions <code>.f2008</code> and <code>.F2008</code> has been
          added.</li>
        <li>The g0 format descriptor is now supported.</li>
        <li>The Fortran 2008 mathematical intrinsics <code>ASINH</code>,
          <code>ACOSH</code>, <code>ATANH</code>, <code>ERF</code>,
          <code>ERFC</code>, <code>GAMMA</code>, <code>LOG_GAMMA</code>,
          <code>BESSEL_*</code>, <code>HYPOT</code>,
          and <code>ERFC_SCALED</code> are now available
          (some of them existed as GNU extension before). Note: The hyperbolic
          functions are not yet supporting complex arguments and the three-
          argument version of <code>BESSEL_*N</code> is not available.</li>
        <li>The bit intrinsics <code>LEADZ</code> and <code>TRAILZ</code>
          have been added.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Java (GCJ)</h3>

<h3>Ada</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Ada runtime now supports multilibs on many platforms including 
    x86_64, SPARC and PowerPC. Their build is enabled by default.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="targets">New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

<h3>ARM</h3>
  <ul>

	and you link to an SVML ABI compatible library.</li>
    <li>A new <code>target</code> attribute was added to allow programmers to change the target options like <code>-msse2</code> or <code>-march=k8</code> for an individual function.  You can also change the target options via the <code>GCC target</code> pragma for functions defined after the pragma.</li>
    <li>GCC can now be configured with
    options <code>--with-arch-32</code>, <code>--with-arch-64</code>,
    <code>--with-cpu-32</code>, <code>--with-cpu-64</code>,
    <code>--with-tune-32</code> and <code>--with-tune-64</code> to
    control the default optimization separately for 32-bit and 64-bit
    modes.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>IA-32/IA64</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for <code>__float128</code> (TFmode) IEEE quad type and
	corresponding TCmode IEEE complex quad type is available
	via the soft-fp library on <code>IA-32/IA64</code> targets.
	This includes basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
	negation, multiplication and division) on <code>__float128</code>
	real and TCmode complex values, the full set of IEEE comparisons
	between <code>__float128</code> values, conversions to and from
	<code>float</code>, <code>double</code> and <code>long double</code>
	floating point types, as well as conversions to and from
	<code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code> integer,
	<code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned long</code> integer and
	<code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code> quad
	(TImode, <code>IA64</code> only) integer types.  Additionally,

	the full set of IEEE rounding modes.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>M68K/ColdFire</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>GCC now supports instruction scheduling for ColdFire V1, V3
    and V4 processors.  (Scheduling support for ColdFire V2 processors
    was added in GCC 4.3.)</li>

    programs requiring many GOT entries on ColdFire.</li>
    <li>The m68k-*-linux-gnu target now builds multilibs by
    default.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>MIPS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>MIPS Technologies have extended the original MIPS SVR4 ABI
        to include support for procedure linkage tables (PLTs)
        and copy relocations.  These extensions allow GNU/Linux
        executables to use a significantly more efficient code
        model than the one defined by the original ABI.</p>

        <p>GCC support for this code model is available via a
        new command-line option, <code>-mplt</code>.  There is also
        a new configure-time option, <code>--with-mips-plt</code>,
        to make <code>-mplt</code> the default.</p>

        <p>The new code model requires support from the assembler,
        the linker, and the runtime C library.  This support is available
        in binutils 2.19 and GLIBC 2.9.</p></li>
    <li>GCC can now generate MIPS16 code for 32-bit GNU/Linux executables
        and 32-bit GNU/Linux shared libraries.  This feature requires
        GNU binutils 2.19 or above.</li>
    <li>Support for RMI's XLR processor is now available through the
        <code>-march=xlr</code> and <code>-mtune=xlr</code> options.</li>
    <li>64-bit targets can now perform 128-bit multiplications inline,
        instead of relying on a <code>libgcc</code> function.</li>
    <li>Native GNU/Linux toolchains now support <code>-march=native</code>
        and <code>-mtune=native</code>, which select the host processor.</li>
    <li>GCC now supports the R10K, R12K, R14K and R16K processors.  The
        canonical <code>-march=</code> and <code>-mtune=</code> names for
        these processors are <code>r10000</code>, <code>r12000</code>,
        <code>r14000</code> and <code>r16000</code> respectively.</li>
    <li>GCC can now work around the side effects of speculative execution
        on R10K processors.  Please see the documentation of the
        <code>-mr10k-cache-barrier</code> option for details.</li>
    <li>Support for the MIPS64 Release 2 instruction set has been added.  The
        option <code>-march=mips64r2</code> enables generation of these
        instructions.</li>
    <li>GCC now supports Cavium Networks' Octeon processor.  This support is
        available through the <code>-march=octeon</code> and
        <code>-mtune=octeon</code> options.</li>
    <li>GCC now supports STMicroelectronics' Loongson 2E/2F processors.  The
        canonical <code>-march=</code> and <code>-mtune=</code> names for
        these processors are <code>loongson2e</code> and
        <code>loongson2f</code>.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="picochip">picochip</h3>

  <p>Picochip is a 16-bit processor.  A typical picoChip contains over 250
  small cores, each with small amounts of memory. There are three processor
  variants (STAN, MEM and CTRL) with different instruction sets and memory
  configurations and they can be chosen using the <code>-mae</code> option.
  </p>

  <p>This port is intended to be a "C" only port.</p>

<h3>Power Architecture and PowerPC</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>GCC now supports the e300c2, e300c3 and e500mc processors.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>S/390, zSeries and System z9/z10</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for the IBM System z10 EC/BC processor has
        been added.  When using the <code>-march=z10</code> option,
        the compiler will generate code making use of instructions
        provided by the General-Instruction-Extension Facility and the
        Execute-Extension Facility.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>VxWorks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>GCC now supports the thread-local storage mechanism used on
    VxWorks.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Xtensa</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>GCC now supports thread-local storage (TLS) for Xtensa processor
    configurations that include the Thread Pointer option.  TLS also requires
    support from the assembler and linker; this support is provided in the
    GNU binutils beginning with version 2.19.</li>
  </ul>
