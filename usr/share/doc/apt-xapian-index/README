Idea:
 - Many data sources each maintain their own data, but provide a plugin to
   index that data in a single, big Xapian database.
 - Every data source has its own db (possibly easy to read plaintext) in
   /var/lib/somewhere
 - Every data source has a tool to keep their own db up to date (e.g.
   downloading new data from the net, or whatever)
 - Every data source installs a plugin in /usr/share/apt-xapian/index/plugins
   that adds information from the data source into Xapian documents during
   indexing

Technicalities:
 - There is a central update procedure, but it is fed enough data to do
   differential updates when xapian will make it faster to do so
 - Next to the database there is a README file with information about how the
   index is built and how it can be queried.  Every indexing plugin adds
   information to this README
 - Xapian values are looked up by index.  Indexes are given names using a
   configuration file in the style of /etc/services, located at
   /etc/apt/xapian-index-values.conf

Writing a plugin:
 - Take a look at plugins/template.py: it contains all the methods and full
   documentations on what they should do.
 - Take a look at the other plugins for examples: there are many of them.

Packages with Xapian bindings that can be uses for querying the database:
 - C++: libxapian-dev
 - Perl: libsearch-xapian-perl
 - Ruby: libxapian-ruby1.8
 - Python: python-xapian
 - Tcl: tclxapian
 - PHP: php5-xapian

 The C++ API documentation is in the package xapian-doc.  The documentation of
 the other languages is in the same package as the bindings.

 Examples can be found in xapian-examples, as well as in apt-xapian-index.

 Some low-level tools to access the database can be found in xapian-tools.
