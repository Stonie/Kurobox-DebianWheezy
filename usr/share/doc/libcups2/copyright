INTRODUCTION

The Common UNIX Printing System(tm), ("CUPS(tm)"), is provided
under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") and GNU Library
General Public License ("LGPL"), Version 2, with exceptions for
Apple operating systems and the OpenSSL toolkit. A copy of the
exceptions and licenses follow this introduction.

The GNU LGPL applies to the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries
located in the "cups" and "filter" subdirectories of the CUPS
source distribution and in the "cups" include directory and
library files in the binary distributions. The GNU GPL applies to
the remainder of the CUPS distribution, including the "pdftops"
filter which is based upon Xpdf.

For those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically
allows you to:

   - Use the CUPS software at no charge.
   - Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source or
     binary form.
   - Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media fee, or
     sell support for the software.

What this license *does not* allow you to do is make changes or
add features to CUPS and then sell a binary distribution without
source code. You must provide source for any changes or additions
to the software, and all code must be provided under the GPL or
LGPL as appropriate. The only exceptions to this are the portions
of the CUPS software covered by the Apple operating system
license exceptions outlined later in this license agreement.

The GNU LGPL relaxes the "link-to" restriction, allowing you to
develop applications that use the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries
under other licenses and/or conditions as appropriate for your
application, driver, or filter.


LICENSE EXCEPTIONS

In addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Apple Inc. grants
the following special exceptions:

     1. Apple Operating System Development License Exception;

	a. Software that is developed by any person or entity
	   for an Apple Operating System ("Apple OS-Developed
	   Software"), including but not limited to Apple and
	   third party printer drivers, filters, and backends
	   for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the
	   CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters
	   or backends provided with CUPS shall not be
	   considered to be a derivative work or collective work
	   based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the
	   mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL.
	   You may therefore distribute linked combinations of
	   the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed
	   Software without releasing the source code of the
	   Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample
	   filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop
	   Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the
	   source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software.

	b. An Apple Operating System means any operating system
	   software developed and/or marketed by Apple Computer,
	   Inc., including but not limited to all existing
	   releases and versions of Apple's Darwin, Mac OS X,
	   and Mac OS X Server products and all follow-on
	   releases and future versions thereof.

	c. This exception is only available for Apple
	   OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software
	   that is distributed for use on other operating
	   systems.

	d. All CUPS software that falls under this license
	   exception have the following text at the top of each
	   source file:

	     This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed
	     Software exception.

     2. OpenSSL Toolkit License Exception;

	a. Apple Inc. explicitly allows the compilation and
	   distribution of the CUPS software with the OpenSSL
	   Toolkit.

No developer is required to provide these exceptions in a
derived work.


KERBEROS SUPPORT CODE

The Kerberos support code ("KSC") is copyright 2006 by Jelmer
Vernooij and is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
warranty.  In no event will the author or Apple Inc. be held
liable for any damages arising from the use of the KSC.

Sources files containing KSC have the following text at the top
of each source file:

     This file contains Kerberos support code, copyright 2006 by
     Jelmer Vernooij.

The KSC copyright and license apply only to Kerberos-related
feature code in CUPS.  Such code is typically conditionally
compiled based on the present of the HAVE_GSSAPI preprocessor
definition.

Permission is granted to anyone to use the KSC for any purpose,
including commercial applications, and to alter it and
redistribute it freely, subject to the following restrictions:

     1. The origin of the KSC must not be misrepresented; you
	must not claim that you wrote the original software. If
	you use the KSC in a product, an acknowledgment in the
	product documentation would be appreciated but is not
	required.

     2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such,
	and must not be misrepresented as being the original
	software.

     3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source
	distribution. 


TRADEMARKS

Apple Inc. has trademarked the Common UNIX Printing System, CUPS,
