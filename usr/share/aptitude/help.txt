  Packages in the package list are displayed like this by default:
idA   libsmbclient                             -2220kB 3.0.25a-1  3.0.25a-2

  The three characters on the left-hand side of the display determine the
current state of the package.  The first letter is the "state" flag,
the second letter is the "action" flag, and the third letter is the
"automatic" flag.  They are followed by the package name, the change
in disk space attributed to it, and finally the current and available
versions of the package.


  The "state" flag is one of the following:

   v - virtual
   B - broken
   u - "unpacked"
   C - half-configured
   H - half-installed
   c - removed, but config-files still present (ie, not purged)
   i - installed
   E - internal error (should not happen)

  The "action" flag is one of the following:

   h - hold
   p - purge
   d - delete (remove)
   B - broken
   i - install
   r - reinstall
   u - upgrade
   F - the available upgrade has been forbidden via "F"

  If present, the "automatic" flag is "A", indicating that the package
was automatically installed and will be removed when nothing depends
on it.


  So, in the example above, libsmbclient is an automatically installed
package.  It could be upgraded from version 3.0.25a-1 to version
3.0.25a-2, but instead it will be deleted, freeing up 2220 kilobytes
of disk space.
