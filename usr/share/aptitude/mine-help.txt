                              Curses Minesweeper

  In Minesweeper, you are presented with a board containing some number of
hidden mines.  In each turn you uncover one or more squares to show their
contents; to win, you must deduce the location of every mine without
uncovering one.  You may place "flags" on the board to remind yourself where
the mines are; flagged squares cannot be uncovered until the flag is removed.
You win when all squares not containing mines have been uncovered.

  Uncovering a square which contains a mine will cause you to lose the game
immediately.  Uncovering a square which does not contain a mine will reveal
its contents: a number showing how many mines are adjacent to that square.  If
no mines are adjacent to a square, all squares adjacent to it will
automatically be exposed.

  To move the cursor around the board, use the arrow keys.  Pressing "f"
will place or remove a flag at that cursor location.  Pressing "enter" on
a covered square will uncover it.  Pressing "enter" on an uncovered square
which has exactly as many flags adjacent to it as mines will cause all
squares surrounding that square to be uncovered (note that if you made a
mistake in placing flags, you will lose when you do this)

  To start a new game, press "n".

  Games can be saved and loaded by pressing "s" and "L" respectively, then
typing the filename you wish to save to or load from.

  To quit, press "q".
