# sysklogd	Cron script to rotate system log files daily.
#
#		If you want to rotate other logfiles daily, edit
#		this script.  An easy way is to add files manually,
#		to add -a (for all log files) to syslogd-listfiles and
#		add some grep stuff, or use the -s pattern argument to
#		specify files that must not be listed.
#
#		This is a configration file.  You are invited to edit
#		it and maintain it on your own.  You'll have to do
#		that if you don't like the default policy
#		wrt. rotating logfiles (i.e. with large logfiles
#		weekly and daily rotation may interfere).  If you edit
#		this file and don't let dpkg upgrade it, you have full
#		control over it.  Please read the manpage to
#		syslogd-listfiles.
