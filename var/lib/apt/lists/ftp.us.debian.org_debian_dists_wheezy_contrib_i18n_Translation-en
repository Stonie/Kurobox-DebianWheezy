Package: dynare-matlab
Description-md5: 90e8fcabb135fcf60e09f0be51774946
Description-en: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

 the upstream source tarball and build a deb that contains them. Note that
 only some adapters really need a firmware file and that firmware files are
 not completely free (in the sense of freely redistributable), that's why
 this package exists.
 .
 For newer kernels (2.6.31+) which have the in-tree prism2_usb driver,
 you can install the prism2-usb-firmware-installer package instead.

 .
 The downloaded file will be used as-is by the 2.6.31 kernel. If you
 have an earlier kernel you will have to install the
 linux-wlan-ng-firmware package instead.
 .
 Note that only some adapters really need a firmware file and that
 firmware files are not completely free (in the sense of freely

Package: python-pyopencl-headers
Description-md5: 7be8d0f651f61987bba939f95462d9d8
Description-en: headers for Python module to access OpenCL parallel computation API
 PyOpenCL lets you access the OpenCL parallel computation API from
 Python. Here's what sets PyOpenCL apart:
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and
    crash-free code.
  * Completeness. PyOpenCL puts the full power of OpenCL’s API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Convenience. While PyOpenCL's primary focus is to make all of OpenCL
    accessible, it tries hard to make your life less complicated as it
    does so--without taking any shortcuts.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All OpenCL errors are automatically
    translated into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyOpenCL’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful, complete documentation and a wiki.
  * Liberal licensing (MIT).
 .
 This package contains header files used by PyOpenCL modules.

Package: raccoon
Description-md5: cd4725a8b4e7cd4796a402535760fb6f
Description-en: preparation of in silico drug screening projects
 The field of computational biology is all about modeling
 physiochemical entities. Structural biology is about how
 those entities look in 3D and behave. And we have a drug
 when we can change that behaviour in a way that we want it
 to be changed - and only that behaviour.
 .
 Some good part of the characterisation of promising
 drug-like compounds for their interaction with a larger protein
 can be done on computers. This package helps with getting
 collections of small ligands prepared to be fitted against
 a particular protein of known structure. That docking itself
 is then to be performed by autodock or autodock-vina.
 .
 Raccoon may not find the drug, but it may well find a
 lead to it. To have this package with Debian shall help
 smaller biochemistry labs and grants an opportunity for the
 general public to educate itself and/or actively join in to
 help the world .... just a bit.

Description-md5: a7034f989f1ae2e40b4db1b5bb58bd47
Description-en: Task scheduler for heterogeneous multicore machines
 StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous
 multicore machines. While many efforts are devoted to design efficient
 computation kernels for those architectures (e.g. to implement BLAS
 kernels on GPUs or on Cell's SPUs), StarPU not only takes care of
 offloading such kernels (and implementing data coherency across
 the machine), but it also makes sure the kernels are executed as
 efficiently as possible.
 .
 This package contains MPI extensions for StarPU.

Package: sugar-etoys-activity
Description-md5: fc76d3df6d970ec1ea0666d73d6a859d
Description-en: Sugar wrapper around the Squeak Etoys programming language
 Sugar is a desktop environment. It is conceived as a platform upon
 which children learn with Sugar Activities. The platform provides
 mechanisms for collaboration, reflection, and exploration. Sugar
 Activities cover a broad range of applications: browsing, drawing,
 composing, writing, programming, etc.
 .
 Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and
 starLOGO. It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple,
 powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by
 end-users. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles,
 presentations, web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc. It includes the
 ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many
 forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.
 .
 The Etoys activity embeds Squeak Etoys into Sugar.

Description-en: SDL-Port of Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of Destiny
 Maybe it was the fact that people got to blow away Nazis. Maybe it was the
 sheer challenge of it all. For whatever reason, Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of
 Destiny, pioneered the first-person shooter genre and brought its legendary
 creators, id Software, worldwide notoriety and numerous awards. In fact, The
 Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame recognized Wolfenstein 3D as helping to
 shape the overall direction of the computer gaming industry.
 .
 Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person shooter
 Wolfenstein 3-D to the cross-platform multimedia library "Simple DirectMedia
 Layer (SDL)" (http://www.libsdl.org). It is meant to keep the original feel
 while taking advantage of some improvements.
 .
 The wolf4sdl game requires additional data files which are not available
 under a free license and cannot be distributed by Debian. Thus, this package
 contains no data files, but current releases of `game-data-packager' are
 able to generate suitable data packages from the publicly available
 Wolfenstein 3-D shareware episode.

 features cassette, floppy, and hard drive emulation, timer interrupt
 emulation, file import and export from the host operating system, support for
 most of the undocumented Z-80 instructions, and a built-in debugger.  Real
 floppy drives can be used, and, if an OSS-compatible sound driver is
 available, application-based sound can be played and real cassettes read and
 written directly through the sound card or via WAVE files.  Several hi-res
 graphics cards are emulated and, in Model 4/4P mode, mice are supported.
 There is also real-time clock, sound card, serial port, joystick, and CPU
 clock speedup emulation.
