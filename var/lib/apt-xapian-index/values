# This file contains the mapping between names of numeric values indexed in the
# APT Xapian index and their index
#
# Xapian allows to index numeric values as well as keywords and to use them for
# all sorts of useful querying tricks.  However, every numeric value needs to
# have a unique index, and this configuration file is needed to record which
# indices are allocated and to provide a mnemonic name for them.
#
# The format is exactly like /etc/services with name, number and optional
# aliases, with the difference that the second column does not use the
# "/protocol" part, which would be meaningless here.
